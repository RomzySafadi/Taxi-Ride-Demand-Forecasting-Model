# Taxi-Ride-Demand-Forecasting-Model
This repository will develop a ride demand forecasting model using NYC Taxi data and Python. Advanced feature engineering and predictive modeling techniques will be utilized to predict ride demand patterns and improve transportation planning. Data will be sourced from Kaggle, and model performance will be evaluated for real-world effectiveness.
