# Taxi-Ride-Demand-Forecasting-Model
This repository will develop a ride demand forecasting model using NYC Taxi data and Python. Advanced feature engineering and predictive modeling techniques will be utilized to predict ride demand patterns and improve transportation planning. Data will be sourced from Kaggle, and model performance will be evaluated for real-world effectiveness.


# Game Plan:

## Data Acquisition:

Data will be pulled from this Kaggle link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/elemento/nyc-yellow-taxi-trip-data/data
The dataset will be explored to understand its structure and content.

# Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

The dataset will be cleaned by handling missing values, outliers, and duplicate records.
Data preprocessing will include encoding categorical variables and normalizing numerical features.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

EDA will be conducted to identify patterns, trends, and relationships within the data.
Data visualization using various plots and graphs will provide insights into the key factors affecting ride demand.

## Feature Engineering:

New features will be created based on domain knowledge and insights gained from EDA.
The most relevant features for modeling will be selected using techniques like correlation analysis and feature importance.

## Model Building:

The dataset will be split into training and testing sets.
Various machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks will be experimented with.
Cross-validation will be used to tune hyperparameters and select the best model.

## Model Evaluation:

The model's performance will be evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and R-squared.
Error analysis will be performed to understand the model's strengths and weaknesses.

## Model Deployment:

The final model will be saved, and a script for predictions will be created.
The entire process and findings will be documented in a comprehensive report.
